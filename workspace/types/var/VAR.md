> There are two types of variables in terms of scope: local, global


## Shadowing

> A variable that takes the same name in the inner block as that of variable in the outer block. This concept is called shadowing.
> Unlike let variables, const variables cannot be shadowed.
> Variable shadowing is a technique in which a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This is also known as masking. This outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner variable is said to mask the outer variable.
