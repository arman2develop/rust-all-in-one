## Class Vs Struct
![Class Vs Struct](../rust/assets/images/class.JPG)

>  Briefly, functions are regarded as **pure**, meaning their behavior is determined solely by their arguments. Methods are inherently **impure**, given that one of their arguments is effectively a side effect.
> objects sometimes implement static methods, which do not include implicit arguments

## Include_Consequences
> Master Rust says:
> Vec=>String=>&str=>slice=>[u8]


## Glossery

> In Rust, global variables are called static variables
