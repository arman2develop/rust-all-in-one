> Refutable patterns: Refutable pattern are let patterns **where the left-hand side and the right-hand side are not compatible** for pattern matching and, in those cases one has to use the exhaustive match expression instead. Up until now, all forms of let patterns we've seen were irrefutable patterns. Irrefutable means that they're able to properly match against the value on the right side of '=' as a valid pattern.
