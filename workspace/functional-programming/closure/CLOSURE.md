## Closure

> Closure to code blocks that are encapsulated in Rust.

> Closures are also known as anonymous functions and lambda functions. 
> (|...|) followed by curly brackets ({...}). The pair of vertical bars lets you define arguments. Lambda functions in > Rust can read variables from within their scope. These are closures.

> Unlike regular functions, lambda functions cannot be defined in global scope(out of main).
